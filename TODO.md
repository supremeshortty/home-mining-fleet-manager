# DirtySats TODO

*Transcribed from Shortty's handwritten notes - 2026-01-31*

## To Do (Active)

- [ ] Do not let program increase or decrease frequency more than 25 in minutes
- [ ] Map out energy page way better / debug
- [ ] Rethink preset miner capabilities  
- [ ] Add "tuning" page to miner cards - if manually tuned, do not auto optimize
  - [ ] Have easy way to revert back to auto tuning
- [ ] Work on charts (add/remove any?)
- [ ] Delete repo and re-push manually to get rid of "daude-" (git history cleanup)
- [ ] Center page texts in their boxes at top of screen
- [ ] Fix auto-optimize bugs (card, reword descriptions)

## Completed (Crossed Out)
- [x] ~~Screen record Hashwatcher~~
- [x] ~~Do not let program auto-change voltage~~
- [x] ~~Remove weather page~~
